/// A non-pooled debug memory manager.
/// This set of memory functions implement a memory manager that allocates,
/// deallocates and resizes memory blocks on demand using the platforms native
/// memory routines. As no attempt is made to preallocate memory; each call to
/// one of the allocation, deallocation or resizing functions will result in a
/// call to one of the platforms native memory management routines.
///
/// Each allocation is increased in size to accommodate a
/// bdMemoryChainElement that is used to record allocations and
/// detect memory overwriting. Allocations are prepended to the
/// bdMallocMemory::m_memoryChain linked list, and deallocations are removed
/// from the list. Hence if memory leaks are detected it is still possible to
/// deallocate all memory by calling releaseAllMemory.
///
/// The bdMemoryChainElement stores enough information
/// to enable a full stack trace to be output for each allocation. This
/// can be a big help in tracking the source of memory leaks.
///
/// The current number of allocations and number of
/// currently allocated bytes are also recorded.
