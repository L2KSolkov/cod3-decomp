/// with arithmetic and comparison operations defined. Internally, limited-range
/// sequence numbers are mapped onto a continuous positive integer space: 4-byte
/// signed integers, with negative space reserved for invalid numbers and -1, the
/// initial number. This internal value can be retrived with \c getValue().
///
/// \note Since this performs serial number arithmetic, the absolute difference
/// between two adjacent sequence numbers should be less than half of the
/// available number space (2^bits / 2).
///
/// \note  Use where internal state is likely to reach 2^31 should be avoided as
/// wrap-around is not yet supported.
