/// This class implements the singleton design pattern.
/// Singletons are classes that have only one instance, and a global point of
/// access.
/// To use \c bdSingleton, declare an empty class to inherit from
/// \c bdSingleton<T>, where \c T is the name of the class you want to access
/// as a singleton.
/// You must also use the \c BD_REGISTER_SINGLETON macro to register \c T. Your
/// singleton can now be accessed via the empty class that you declared.
/// Since all memory allocations must go through bdMemory, \c bdSingleton 's
/// cannot be constructed "pre-main". Instead lazy construction is used, and
/// \c bdSingleton instances are constructed on the first call to their
/// respective getInstance() methods. This means that a \c bdSingleton cannot
/// be accessed until bdCore::init() has been called.
/// To ensure that only the singleton instance of \c T is created you can
/// prevent users from creating their own instances of \c T. To do this make
/// default constructor of \c T and the default constructor of the blank class
/// protected. In doing so you must also make \c bdSingleton<T> a friend of
/// \c T so it has access to this constructor.
/// See bdError for a complete example.
