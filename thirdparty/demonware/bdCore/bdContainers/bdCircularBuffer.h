///
/// This buffer provides a wrapping mode (circular), and a shifting mode
/// (non-circular) of operation. Default is wrapping mode, and shifting is
/// activated by passing in \a false as the second parameter to the constructor.
///
/// Access to the buffer is in "blocks" -- maximally long contiguous
/// parts of the buffer (in wrapping mode, available block of free space
/// can be shorter than total available free space, due to it being spread
/// across the begining and the end of the buffer).
///
/// In shifting mode, it is necessary to call \a alignUsedBlock, which shifts
/// all of the data in the buffer to its beggining and thus ensures there is
/// space available in it.
