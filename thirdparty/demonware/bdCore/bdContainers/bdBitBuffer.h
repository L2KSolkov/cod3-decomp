/// A variable sized FIFO buffer.
/// This buffer class stores data, which can inserted and extracted as
/// fundamental types or as an arbitrary amount of binary data. A datum is
/// stored in only the required number of bits required to represent its
/// precision. For example, a datum inserted as a boolean is represented by one
/// bit.
/// No type information is stored in the buffer, therefore insertion and
/// extraction operation must be performed carefully and symmetrically. In
/// particular, data should be read out in the same order that they were
/// written with, and with matching read and write functions.
/// This class is useful for serialization operations that require optimal
/// memory and CPU performance.
/// The first bit in the bitBuffer indicates whether or not the bitBuffer is type checked.
