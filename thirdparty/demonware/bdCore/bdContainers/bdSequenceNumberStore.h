/// Implements a basic unreliable sliding window of sequence numbers for detection
/// of duplicate, and old packets. The window is of a constant size of 32 or
/// 64 numbers (see \c m_bitmap). Sequence number can be simply fed into the
/// window through \c check() method, which updates the window and returns the
/// status of the sequence number in question. At any one time only numbers
/// falling inside the window are expected. Older numbers (where sequence numbers
/// are expected to be incremented by 1, x "older" y refers to x < y) are
/// rejected. Numbers within the window are checked for duplicates. Numbers
/// newer than the newest one in the window cause it to advance forward. However,
/// numbers that are further away than a whole window are rejected as well.
